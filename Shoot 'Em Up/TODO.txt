Classes:
	Time Piece: Cowboy
		Plan: Predict enemy movements and call them out with charged shots. Win with the first six shots because reload is lengthy.
		- The Long Arm: Holster gun and charge up (can be canceled) if charged for long enough, can take a hitscan shot. Can't move while charging
		
	Alistair: Melee fighter. Can avoid damage fairly well and is very lethal, but no ranged options.
		Plan: Use damage avoidance and different attack angles to get around enemy projectiles and get close.
		- Dive: Horizontal flurry of blows that dodges all attacks.
		- Uppercut: SHORYUKEN up a ways. Dodges attacks.
		
	TBD: Archer, shoots in an arc.
		Plan: Use area denial to keep enemy off of level ground with you, then use shot arc to poke at them where they can't hit you.
		- Wall jump
		- Flaming arrow that makes a blanket of fire on the ground, can be used for area denial
		
	TBD: Grenadier a la Junkrat or Demoman.
		Plan: Use mine and sticky bomb to corner opponents, then lob grenades at them.
		- Sticky grenade / trap that sticks to walls and is remote detonated.
		- Proximity Mine
		
	TBD: Shotgun
		- Double Barrelled: Must reload after 2 shots, each shot is a cone with moderate range
		- Skeet Shooter: Shoot diagonally upwards at a 45 degree angle
	
	TBD: Pro Wrestler (MUSCLE POWER)
		- The Chair: Swing a folding chair and reflect projectiles that you hit with it. If it hits an enemy, one shot them.
		- Bodyslam: Fall straight down from where you are, one shot any opponents you hit.
		
	The Bandit Queen: TBD
		- TBD
		- TBD
		
	TBD: Flamethrower?
		
	TBD: Boomerang?
	
	TBD: Magician? Maybe can shoot through platforms? Probably not though...
	


		
		
Design Goals:
	- Should be practical to dodge opponent's shots on reaction for the most part.
	- Different characters should have different directions of attack, leading to a footsies game.
	- There shouldn't be a way to get to a position that is incredibly hard to dislodge you from. (Favor offense over defense)
	- All abilities should be immediately recognizable through sound and/or animation.
	- Each character should have a unique playstyle and visual style. Differentiate between similar characters when possible.
	- Movement speeds should be slow enough that you can predict and react to jumping/falling off ledges but not slow enough to feel boring.
	- Keep character matchups as balanced as possible.
	- You should always be able to win by out-thinking your opponent.
