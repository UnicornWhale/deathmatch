TODO (Roughly Prioritized):
	- (Either) Sugoi's double jump doesn't work off keyboard controls.
	- (Either) P2 after deselecting can't move cursor
	- (Kyle) Add walk cycles.
	- (Kyle) Add a way to specify ranges of time during an animation for things to happen.
	- (Kyle) Add a way to specify what fps a certain animation should play at, instead of a global timing.
	- (Either) Make a delay on when the projectile is created so that the animations can sync up with when the projectile appears.
	- (Duncan) Deal with resolution.
	- (Either) Make it possible to play Bo5s or Bo3s or whatever so we don't have to restart whenever someone dies.
	- (Either) Add Towerfall style wrapping of the game area (top to bottom, side to side)?
	- (Kyle) Add configurable controls
	- (Kyle) Add sound/make sounds for the game.
	- (Either) Add other characters.
	- (Either) Add capability for up to four players (and possibly a way to set teams)
	
BUGS:
	- Upon returning to character select after a game, cursors are in upredictable places and sometimes won't move.
	
	
	
Classes:
	(Done) Brawn: Dude with big gun.
		Plan: Use damage absorbtion and high hp pool to slowly corner enemy with your slow moving projectiles.
		- Flex: Absorb all damage either completely or at drastically reduced rate for a very short time.
		- Blaze of Glory: On death, rip shirt off and become invincible for 5 seconds before finally dying.
		
	(Done-ish) Sugoi: Ninja.
		Plan: Use movement abilities to get around other people's shots and take carefully aimed shots of her own.
		- Quick: Shuriken's in air go at a diagonal down angle (sheik needle style).
		- Nimble: Double jump and maybe cling to walls.
		
	Alistair: Melee fighter. Can avoid damage fairly well and is very lethal, but no ranged options.
		Plan: Use damage avoidance and different attack angles to get around enemy projectiles and get close.
		- Dive: Horizontal flurry of blows that dodges all attacks.
		- Uppercut: SHORYUKEN up a ways. Dodges attacks.
		
	TBD: Archer, shoots in an arc.
		Plan: Use area denial to keep enemy off of level ground with you, then use shot arc to poke at them where they can't hit you.
		- Wall jump
		- Flaming arrow that makes a blanket of fire on the ground, can be used for area denial
		
	TBD: Grenadier a la Junkrat or Demoman.
		Plan: Use mine and sticky bomb to corner opponents, then lob grenades at them.
		- Sticky grenade / trap that sticks to walls and is remote detonated.
		- Proximity Mine
		
	TBD: Cowboy
		Plan: Predict enemy movements and call them out with charged shots. Win with the first six shots because reload is lengthy.
		- Six Shooter: Must reload after six shots
		- The Long Arm: Holster gun and charge up (can be canceled) if charged for long enough, can take a hitscan shot. Can't move while charging
		
	TBD: Shotgun
		- Double Barrelled: Must reload after 2 shots, each shot is a cone with moderate range
		- Skeet Shooter: Shoot diagonally upwards at a 45 degree angle
	
	TBD: Pro Wrestler (MUSCLE POWER)
		- The Chair: Swing a folding chair and reflect projectiles that you hit with it. If it hits an enemy, one shot them.
		- Bodyslam: Fall straight down from where you are, one shot any opponents you hit.
		
	TBD: Flamethrower?
		
	TBD: Boomerang?
	
	TBD: Magician? Maybe can shoot through platforms? Probably not though...
	


		
		
Design Goals:
	- Should be practical to dodge opponent's shots on reaction for the most part.
	- Different characters should have different directions of attack, leading to a footsies game.
	- There shouldn't be a way to get to a position that is incredibly hard to dislodge you from. (Favor offense over defense)
	- All abilities should be immediately recognizable through sound and/or animation.
	- Each character should have a unique playstyle and visual style. Differentiate between similar characters when possible.
	- Movement speeds should be slow enough that you can predict and react to jumping/falling off ledges but not slow enough to feel boring.
	- Keep character matchups as balanced as possible.
	- You should always be able to win by out-thinking your opponent.
