TODO:
	- (Kyle) Brawn's animations play properly, Sugoi's don't. Figure that out. I'm really confused.
	- Add in Blaze of Glory, Quick, and both ultis. Fix Sugoi's wall cling.
	- (Duncan) Deal with resolution.
	- Add capability for up to four players (and possibly a way to set teams?)
	- Add configurable controls (bonus to make sure game pads work as controllers. I think they should by default with slick)
	- Add sound/make sounds for the game.
	
	
	
	
	
Classes:
	(Added) Brawn: Dude with big gun. Original concept is a machine gun but we'll have to assess how that works with the amount of health and the style of gameplay we want.
		(Done) - Flex: Absorb all damage either completely or at drastically reduced rate for a very short time.
		- Blaze of Glory: On death, rip shirt off and become invincible for 5 seconds before finally dying.
		- One Man Army (Ulti): Big ol' barrage of weaponry.
		
	(Added) Sugoi: Ninja lady. Very mobile and skill based. Throws shurikens.
		- Quick: Works on ground, in air, and as a wave dash.
		(Half Done) - Nimble: Double jump and maybe cling to walls.
		- Shadow Clone (Ulti): Reveals current position as a fake (little log anime schtick). Teleports in any cardinal direction immediately.
		
	Alister: Melee fighter. Can avoid damage fairly well and is very lethal, but no ranged options.
		- Dive: Horizontal flurry of blows that dodges all attacks.
		- Uppercut: SHORYUKEN up a ways. Dodges attacks.
		- ONE PUNCH (Ulti): Big horizontal punch that one shots anyone it connects with.
