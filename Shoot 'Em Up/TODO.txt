TODO:
	- Add in Blaze of Glory, Quick, and both ultis.
	- Add Alister and his abilities.
	- (Duncan) Deal with resolution.
	- Add capability for up to four players (and possibly a way to set teams?)
	- Add configurable controls (bonus to make sure game pads work as controllers. I think they should by default with slick)
	- Add sound/make sounds for the game.
	
BUGS:
	- Upon returning to character select after a game, cursors are in upredictable places.
