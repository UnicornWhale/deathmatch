TODO:
	- (Duncan) Add a state system to manage which animations the heroes are playing and also what they can/can't do from each state
		(temp list)
		- Idle
		- Jump
		- Rising
		- Falling
		- Shoot
		- Any additional states from abilities
		- Also probably dead but we already have an alive variable, I guess mix that in.
	- Add in the existing classes abilities. Also entails finding controls for them somewhere.
	- (Duncan) Deal with resolution. Either lock resolution and set the screen to that resolution always, or set up a way to deal with multiple resolutions and a place to change them.
	- (Kyle) Add capability for up to four players (and possibly a way to set teams?)
	- Add configurable controls (bonus to make sure game pads work as controllers. I think they should by default with slick)
	- Add sound/make sounds for the game.
	- Add map selection after character selection and add more maps.
	
	
BUG-FIXING:
	- Go through each state and look at interactions that happen with the init method only being called once and not each time the state is entered.
	
	
	
	
	
Classes:
	Brawn: Dude with big gun. Original concept is a machine gun but we'll have to assess how that works with the amount of health and the style of gameplay we want.
		- Flex: Absorb all damage either completely or at drastically reduced rate for a very short time.
		- Blaze of Glory: On death, rip shirt off and become invincible for 5 seconds before finally dying.
		- One Man Army (Ulti): Big ol' barrage of weaponry.
		
	Sugoi: Ninja lady. Very mobile and skill based. Throws shurikens.
		- Quick: Works on ground, in air, and as a wave dash.
		- Nimble: Double jump and maybe cling to walls.
		- Shadow Clone (Ulti): Reveals current position as a fake (little log anime schtick). Teleports in any cardinal direction immediately.
		
	Alister: Melee fighter. Can avoid damage fairly well and is very lethal, but no ranged options.
		- Dive: Horizontal flurry of blows that dodges all attacks.
		- Uppercut: SHORYUKEN up a ways. Dodges attacks.
		- ONE PUNCH (Ulti): Big horizontal punch that one shots anyone it connects with.
